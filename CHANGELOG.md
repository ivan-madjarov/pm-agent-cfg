# Changelog

All notable changes to the PM+ Agent Configuration tool are documented here.
## [1.6.0] - 2025-10-02
### Added
- (Windows/Linux/PowerShell) Concise performance mode summary line in status output: `Performance Mode (summary): <mode>` for quick identification (low|medium|high|ultra|unset|custom).
 - (Windows Batch) Refined export filename timestamp format (removed locale comma / fractional seconds to ensure clean filenames).

### Fixed
- (Windows Batch) Export option crash: Replaced locale-dependent FOR date/time token parsing (causing ". was unexpected at this time." on some regional formats) with sanitizer-based timestamp generation.

### Fixed
- (Windows) Ticket #202510024200014: `--mode unset` previously rejected; now accepted directly without requiring separate `--unset` flag.
- (Windows) Locale issue: removed PowerShell dependency for hex conversion (avoids failures on hosts where `powershell` command name/localization caused errors). Implemented native CMD arithmetic.
- (PowerShell) Added matching performance mode summary to maintain parity with batch/Linux scripts.

### Changed
- (Windows/Linux/Docs) Unified unset handling via `--mode unset`; retained `--unset` / legacy note for backward compatibility.
- (Linux) Direct `--mode unset` support (formerly required standalone `--unset`).
- (Docs) Updated Windows & Linux guides plus README to mention performance mode summary line and unified unset usage.

## [1.6.1] - 2025-10-02
## [1.6.2] - 2025-10-02
### Added
- (Windows Batch / PowerShell) Registry export feature: `--export` (batch) / `-Export` (PowerShell) and interactive menu option (Batch: 9, PowerShell: 9) producing a timestamped `.reg` file for troubleshooting.
- (PowerShell) Test Registry Access function and menu option 8 for parity with batch script (diagnose registry key accessibility and installation issues).

### Changed
- (Windows Batch/PowerShell) Registry export writes to the current working directory (not TEMP). Explicit failure if directory is not writable.
- (Windows Batch & PowerShell) Interactive menus renumbered for parity (Test Registry = 8, Export = 9, Exit = 10 in batch; PowerShell mirrors numbering where applicable).
- (PowerShell) Export naming standardized; removed `-ExportPath` parameter for consistency and simplicity.
- (Windows Batch) Export operation (menu option 9 / `--export`) now intentionally exits after success with a summary to eliminate fragile post-export menu looping on certain locales.

### Fixed
- (Windows Batch) Locale-dependent export timestamp crashes (`. was unexpected at this time.`) eliminated by abandoning complex `%DATE%` / `%TIME%` token parsing in favor of a simplified time+random strategy.
- (Windows Batch) Removed comma / fractional second artifacts from filenames (sanitized timestamp generation).
- (Windows Batch) Missing internal label reference when using `--export` (legacy call to `:export_registry`) now resolved via an alias label pointing to the implemented `:export_registry_exit` logic.
- (PowerShell) Fallback minimal writer uses standardized filename when `reg.exe export` fails.
- (PowerShell) Added GNU-style double-dash flag compatibility (`--export`, `--status`, `--mode`, `--unset`, `--help`, `--menu`, `--verbose`) for parity with batch usage patterns; manual mode validation replaces previous ValidateSet to enable preprocessing.

### Notes
- Batch filename format: `pm-agent-dca-<HHMMSS><RANDOM>.reg` (time+random only) for maximum compatibility; PowerShell keeps full datetime pattern `pm-agent-dca-YYYYMMDDHHmmss.reg` for richer timestamping.
- Export always targets the directory from which the script is launchedâ€”ensure it's writable (run elevated if required).
- Linux variant uses file collection (`PerformanceSettings.json`) instead of registry export; no export flag required.

## [1.5.0] - 2025-09-24
### Added
- Unset functionality: Added "unset limits (unlimited)" option to remove performance limits and restore agent defaults

## [1.6.2] - 2025-10-02
### Added
- Registry export feature (Batch `--export` / PS `-Export` or `--export`) with timestamped `.reg` output in the current working directory.
- PowerShell Test Registry Access (menu option 8) matching batch functionality.
- PowerShell GNU-style double-dash flag compatibility: `--mode`, `--unset`, `--status`, `--export`, `--menu`, `--help`, `--verbose`.

### Changed
- Batch export (menu option 9 / `--export`) now intentionally exits after a successful export (clear UX; avoids locale edge cases that previously broke the menu loop).
- PowerShell export keeps the session open (non-disruptive for continued diagnostics).
- Standardized export naming: Batch uses `pm-agent-dca-<HHMMSS><RANDOM>.reg`; PowerShell uses `pm-agent-dca-YYYYMMDDHHmmss.reg` (higher precision timestamp).
- Menus renumbered/confirmed for parity (batch & PowerShell: Test Registry = 8, Export = 9, Exit = 10).

### Fixed
- Batch: Eliminated locale-dependent timestamp parsing crash (`. was unexpected at this time.`) by removing fragile `%DATE%/%TIME%` token FOR loops.
- Batch: Removed comma/fractional artifacts from filenames (sanitized time + random approach).
- Batch: Missing `:export_registry` label (legacy call path) restored via alias to `:export_registry_exit`.
- PowerShell: Fallback minimal export now produces standardized file when `reg.exe` export fails.
- PowerShell: Manual mode validation replaces prior `ValidateSet` to enable preprocessing of GNU-style arguments.

### Notes
- Export requires an elevated, writable working directory. Failure is explicit with guidance.
- Batch exit-on-export is a deliberate design choice to guarantee deterministic completion on long-tail locale environments.

## [1.6.1] - 2025-10-02
### Added
- Performance mode summary line: `Performance Mode (summary): <mode>` across Batch, PowerShell, and Linux.

### Changed
- Unified unset handling (`--mode unset`) while retaining legacy `--unset` for backward compatibility.

### Fixed
- Batch: Replaced hex conversion PowerShell dependency with native CMD arithmetic (improves portability & reliability).
- PowerShell / Linux: Parity maintenance for summary output.

## [1.6.0] - 2025-10-02
Initial stabilization tranche preceding export work.

### Added
- Foundational improvements enabling later export feature (refined status outputs, preparatory menu alignment groundwork).

### Fixed
- Early locale parsing inconsistencies in preparation for later timestamp simplification.

## [1.5.0] - 2025-09-24
### Added
- Unset functionality (remove limits / restore defaults).
- Registry access diagnostics (Batch option 8).
- Linux implementation achieving feature parity.

### Fixed
- Menu loop reliability across platforms (post-operation return consistency).
- Multiple registry permission and verification edge cases.

### Changed
- Unified option numbering and enhanced success/partial reporting.

## [1.4.0] - 2025-08-11
Service management and interactive UX enhancements; improved error handling and status reporting.

## [1.3.0] - 2025-01-31
Introduced PowerShell interactive menu; major service restart logic corrections in Batch.

## [1.2.0] - 2024-01-19
Initial public release (Batch + PowerShell) with performance mode configuration and interactive menus.

---

## Upgrade & Migration Notes
- 1.6.x introduces export capability and safer locale handling; no breaking changes.
- Older automation invoking `--unset` still works; prefer `--mode unset` going forward.
- Batch scripts relying on post-export continuation must adapt (export now exits intentionally starting 1.6.2).

## Known Issues
- Windows: Requires elevation; lack of elevation produces explicit failures.
- PowerShell EXE compilation (optional) may trigger unsigned execution warnings (code signing planned).
